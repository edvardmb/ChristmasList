You need to allow scripts from unauthorized sources in order for the JS to run. 

I am aware of my solution with accessing pictures does not work as intended, by using LocalStorage, but I was struggling with the token getting removed from the link to the image when I tried to save the link directly in the object. By using localstorage I was at least able to show pictures when you uploaded them.
